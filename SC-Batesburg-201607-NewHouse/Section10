The Empty Lot - July 30, 2016
D3200DSC010258.jpg View from the road.  The house will go just behind Ellen's car
D3200DSC010260.jpg Road from where the house will be - 250' back
D3200DSC010261.jpg The view back into the rest of the property - it goes about another 750' back
D3200DSC010263.jpg She's standing at 600' into the lot.  We remember it was wooded but I didn't remember it being this densely wooded.  Cool :-)
D3200DSC010264.jpg Looks like Holly - we're ready for Christmas all year 'round

D3200DSC010272.jpg I'm standing on the property line.  Just in front of the second orange road side is the realtor sign at the other side of the property.
D3200DSC010273.jpg There's a nice stand of mature pines that are spaced enough for a gazebo and a couple of picnic tables.  Instant outdoor family gathering spot :-)
